#Multiple Disease Prediction Model (Machine Learning Project)


This project leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to predict three major diseases: diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease. By inputting various patient parameters (such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc.), the model provides predictions that may assist in early detection and diagnosis. The main goal of the project is to aid in improving health outcomes through data-driven insights and early intervention. The model is deployed using Heroku, making it easily accessible to users via a web interface.

The models used in this project were trained on publicly available datasets and optimized for accuracy. Various machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression were utilized to ensure robust predictions. The project employs a range of data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions, ensuring the model can generalize well to new data.

#Disease Facts:

1.Diabetes:
Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting how the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Globally, more than 422 million people suffer from diabetes, and it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection through predictive models like this can prevent complications such as kidney failure, blindness, and heart disease.

2.Heart Disease:
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally. They account for approximately 17.9 million deaths per year, representing 31% of all global deaths. The early detection of heart disease risk factors, such as high cholesterol and hypertension, can help reduce the mortality rate and improve patient outcomes. This model assists in identifying such risks early on.

3.Parkinson’s Disease:
Parkinson’s is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting movement, speech, and other functions. With over 10 million people worldwide affected by Parkinson’s disease, there is an urgent need for early detection and intervention. By predicting the likelihood of developing Parkinson’s, patients can seek treatment earlier, potentially delaying the progression of the disease.
